### What is an OSPO?

<!--truncate-->

Today, we solidify our definition of what the United Healthgroup open source program office, or UHG OSPO, does. We are the center of competency for this organization's open source operations and structure. The Open Source Program Office (OSPO) owns and promotes the UHG open source strategy. After 7 years of service, we continue to focus on training and supporting developers in the open source domain. Our operations include setting code use, distribution, and selection. We train developers in methods of open contribution with support from Optum Technology University.

Companies create OSPOs to manage their relationships with the open source ecosystems they depend upon. It collaborates with engineering, legal, security, invention, product, technology, scientific, and strategic Open Source Software (OSS) communities to verify or adapt our strategy to implement OSS Governance as an enabler for employees to shape and influence technology needed to solve tomorrow’s problems. This provides the unique opportunity to stoke innovation, realize savings and encourage an engineering mindset, while supporting the enterprise’s social responsibility initiatives.

At their crux, OSPOs manage the inbound and outbound flow of open source projects in their company's ecosystem. The company's software health and sustainability are partly dependent on the Open Source Software ecosystem surrounding these activities. In one role, OSPOs are rangers of the organization's OSS ecosystem. In another, OSPOs are promoters of action in an open source community. OSPOs are inventors sitting at the intersection between technology and social responsibility.

At UHG, our OSPO exists to accomplish a set of primary objectives.
