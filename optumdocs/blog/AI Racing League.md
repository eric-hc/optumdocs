### AI Racing League

<!--truncate-->

In March of 2019, I approached our executive leadership team in Optum Technology. We discussed the importance of making artificial intelligence (AI) a core part of the company culture. We brainstormed with stories of other companies' efforts. Then the conversation turned to work I had been doing outside of Optum teaching kids about AI. My partners and I have built coding clubs, such as CoderDojo Twin Cities. A lot of companies use an Open Source system called DonkeyCar to teach AI. We discussed how this might be a vehicle for our technical talent to contribute back by mentoring in communities.

These racing leagues are a great, innovative way to bring STEM mentorship to the next generation of healthcare leaders. The events are filled with fun and laughter. Clearly, these people and kids are having fun learning AI! Our Optum leaders were supportive - we agreed that Optum wants to invest in STEM mentorship. But how would we get the ball rolling to make this happen?

My leadership time guided me to write a proposal. Then they helped me identify a business sponsor in our internal training division. I also met people who were passionate about education and curriculum development, a topic I am also very interested in. We ran our first "AI Racing League" event on Aug. 6th 2019.

We learned a LOT about introducing AI/ML to non-technical staff during this first session. First of all, it was REALLY fun! We also learned how to break all the content and we designed a topic dependency graph of all the topics that we wanted to cover: RC car hardware, Nivida Nano hardware, calibration, cameras, UNIX shell, Python, data analysis, Jupyter Notebooks, computer vision, GPUs, training, model management, model evaluation.

For each of these concepts, we gathered documentation and resources and created breakout tables that our participants visited for the first part of the events. Then we broke down into teams and each team got a car they had to train. We built GPU servers that could build models in under five minutes.

The result? Many of our participants told us this was the “funnest” class they have EVER attended as part of our internal training. Since that event, we have had about a dozen follow-up events. As soon as we can gather again in person, we hope to continue live AI Racing League events. In the meantime, we're revising our materials with a focus on work on growth and multi-modal expansion. We are preparing for another great in-person racing season. We would love to collaborate with others that might find ways to host our curricula online and convert our materials for use primarily online. We now have many trained mentors and hundreds of alumni of the classes that are strongly recommending these courses to their colleagues. Reach out to me to connect!

We're happy to discuss how to bring this STEM mentorship program in ML/AI into your school or club!
